# Multi-MP3-Player (Unfinished)
Made in Java using JavaFX. 

Multi MP3 Player was made to allow audio engineers to bundle different audio files - such as individual bass/drum/guitar/vocal 
tracks - into one player for simultaneous playback. Multi MP3 Player provides solo/mute functions for each track, so the client 
has the ability to hear certain parts of the mix separately, or blend different tracks together to hear every detail in the mix.
